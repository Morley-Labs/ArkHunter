# ArkHunter

ArkHunter is a tool for analyzing Cardano network parameter changes, aiming to provide insights into how the network evolves over time. It is intended to help developers and stakeholders stay informed, but right now, it's in its early stages and frankly, it’s pretty rough.

## Overview

ArkHunter is meant to:
- Monitor Cardano network parameter changes.
- Offer historical data and insights into parameter evolution.
- Help users understand the impact of changes on the ecosystem.

Currently, it’s more of a prototype than a polished tool. It captures some basic changes and displays them in a pretty basic way. There's no advanced analytics, and the UI isn't winning any design awards anytime soon. But it works...mostly.

## Current Status

This project is very much a work in progress. Here’s what it does (and doesn’t) do right now:

### What's Working:
- Tracks basic network parameters and logs changes over time.
- Displays parameter changes in a minimalistic interface.
- Provides a simple way to see the history of certain parameters.

### What's Not So Great:
- The user interface is barebones and could use a lot more polish.
- It only tracks a limited set of parameters for now.
- Advanced features like real-time alerts, detailed analytics, or deep insights are non-existent.
- The codebase is rough and needs refactoring.

## Roadmap

ArkHunter has a long way to go, but here are some of the things we're aiming for:
- Improve the UI for a more user-friendly experience.
- Support more network parameters.
- Add advanced data visualization and analytics tools.
- Implement notifications for real-time parameter changes.
- Integrate with other Cardano tools and dashboards.

No promises on when or even if these features will happen, but that's the vision.

## Installation

If you’re brave enough to try this out, here’s how to get it running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Morley-Labs/ArkHunter.git
cd ArkHunter
npm install
npm run dev
```

This is built using Vite and React, so you’ll need Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Contributing

If you want to help out (or even just tell us how bad it is), feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. We could use the help.

## Disclaimer

This is experimental and far from production-ready. It’s under active development, and things will break. A lot. Use it at your own risk.
